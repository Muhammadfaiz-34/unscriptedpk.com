        <p class="p1-text">A sparkling opening ceremony inside the bedouin-tent inspired Al Bayt stadium 
            invited the world to come togather as qatar as the fifa world cup to come togather
            in Qatar as the fifa world cup kicked off for the first time in the middle east. Amidst all
            the criticism, the opening ceremony of FIFA World cup had much to offer. Ghanim muhammad Al Muftah
            a Qatari youtuber and philanthropist with caudal regression syndrome  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghanim_Al-Muftah">Read more about him</a>, Qatar's Fifa ambassador and one of qatar
            youngest entrepreneurs opened the ceremony with the Hollywood legend Morgan freeman. The arabian Nights is themed opening ceremony of Fifa world cup 2022 not only celebrated the culture of traditions
            of Qatar, but also sent a message to unite the cultures from all over the world. Its a global message of peace and shows how Muslims celebrate their events without harming anyone and showing a positive image of 
            whole arab countries to the world, Maybe its the beginning of good for Asia and surrounding which were neglected from the west part of world. It is a global message of peace and harmony that inspired sanity amidst 
            all the insane and prejudiced hue and cry that shrouded the FIFA World Cup 2022 at Qatar before the opening ceremony. </p><img src="../Images/opening ceremony.qatar.jpg">
            <p class="p1-text">Morgan freeman what a guy he is and Al Muftah had a dialogue over the 13th verse of the Holy Quran. freeman, who had a surprised appearance at the opening ceremony with his commanding voice began to posing the question which were really intellectual, "how can so many countries, Languages and cultures
                came togather if only the path is accepted?". Responding to Morgan Al Muftan gave the refernce to to the 13th verse of Surah Hujaraat, with articulary excellence Al Muftah Said "O Humanity! we have created you from male and a female, and we have divided you into races and tribes so you can meet each other. The most superior of you in sight
                of Allah is the one who has the most taqwa, Allah is all knowing aware". "to concur , freeman went on to say, i can see it. what us here right now is much greater than what seperates us." Al Muftan Replied " We Will be raised ti believe what we are scattered across this world as nation and find beauty in our differneces ". And this went viral 
                on social media and its none more than an argument of two people from different religion making an argument one from religion perspective and one from humanity perspective.
                <br>So much negative has been written posted and shared about World cup in Qatar but despite everything this world cup gains the most attention never seen people so attached to their tv screens for a football match in Pakistan
                including me who always have played it but never been able to watch it.

            <p class="p1-text">I was so sticked to the screen throughout the whole world watching the opening ceremony along with every single match despite having tough timmings it was my first time and also many other people i know watched it for the first time but it wasn't just about that it was happening in middle east for the first time but it had everything suspense, 
                excitement and more upset which made people come through and not gonna lie i never saw people talking about it in Pakistan so much in those days and everyone was watching it and i know so many people tried to make it a failure but at last Allah is always the best planner. It made the World cup controversial but it attracted tons of new people which were not attracted to
                this sport. For me obviously the biggest upset of this world cup was Saudia Arab Beating world class Argentina no one expected it thats why it attracted tons of new eyeballs making it the best world in this decade too.

            <p class=p1-text>All matches were perfect <br>
            Until the mega match the final of this world cup happened and i mean it was perfect from every angle every single second of it was perfect Argentina came with Messi heroics and France with Mbappe was looking dangerous and everybody knew what was coming our way. Kicked off and we saw argentina putting two goals in the bin in first half and we thought that maybe its done but then Mbappe came with 2 goals within 90 seconds both we equal. the match intensifies full time and both teams equal on full time, more time 30 minutes more both teams scored 
            goals in extra time kylian Mbappe with 3 goals just second person to have a hatrick in world cups final after Geoff Hurst and extra time is done. <br>
            Now its time for penalties Mbappe takes cold penalty so does messi and then Martinez shows his magic and what saves from him just like he knocked out netherland he knocks out France and Messi's dreams comes true and i got emotional for nothing, and i know every football fan reaction would have been same despite they love other players.
