        I made this website not as my project, I Started writting in my matriculation and after
        choosing Information Technology i wanted to make sure to add my own website in my 
        portfolio <br>
        I made this website from sctach after learning frontend and all the blogs already uploaded are written by me.
        I will be uploading Blogs every week and if you want me to cover any topic please let me know.
        These Blogs are totally my thoughts and opinnions and knowledge which is researched through internet and Books.
