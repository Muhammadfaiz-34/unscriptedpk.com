            Pakistan and Democracy
        </h3>
        <p class="p1-text">
            In recent times Pakistan has gone through tougher times not the first time but this time the picture was really clear how the planning was plotted and how plans has been executed
            As a youngster, I know that democracy is always been shrouded with uncertainty and lamented in sackcloth and ashes. For decades, the nation's trust in declining, signaling that not all was well. Recently, both political forces have unleashed a barrage of attacks on the bedrock of democratic government, threatening checks and balances, civil liberties, civil rights, and long-established norms. In last year's political-judicial scuffle, several frontline politicians discarded the nation of facts and necessary anchors of political discourse and challenged the legitimacy of each other's politicians, challenging the democratic structure of the weak country which was already going to the crisis of wealth and was facing challenges from all over the world.
