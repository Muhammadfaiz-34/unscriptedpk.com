                Anatol lieven in his book Pakistan A hard country conjectured that if the USA, India or both together invade Pakistan and thereby precipitate the disintegration the likelihood is that country will hold itself together, and that if it eventually collapses, it will be Islamist extremist but climate change and especially grim threat of whole south Asia – that finishes it off (lieven 5). It has been a tragedy that Pakistan has ignored this massive threat to its existence. The Floods in 2010 had to a great extent damaged, changed and weakend the system at political, administrative, and socio-economic level. However, the current floods in 2022 are a dirge for a state of Pakistan and its oblivion on the most significant concern for its very existence. The floods in 2022 have damaged the already feeble national infrastructure of Pakistan. Furthermore, it has slowed down the already wavering economic process.

                The unprecedented monsoon season has affected all four of country provinces with Punjab and Sindh the most affected ones, nearly 3 lac homes have been destroyed, numerous roads rendered impassable and electricity outages have been wide-spread, affecting millions of people. “ I went to Karachi last year after floods via road and saw the floods situation myself and my god I can’t believe what I saw maybe too young to saw it because all I could see was destroyed fields, destroyed homes, people standing on the side of the road, the roads full of water you couldn’t see the roads and believe me when I saw it that it looks soo much worse when saw with the naked eye rather than looking at our tv screens”.
            The government did deployed soldiers and civilian authorities to help the people stranded but at last what you see looks helpless and tears in your eyes, but not to worry because we slept good at night after eating good food and for us now that what all matters.

                Flooding from swat river overnight affected northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where tens of thousands of people especially in Charsada and Nowshera district have been evacuated from their homes to relief camps set up in government buildings, many has taken the road sides, flash flooding washed away all the crops in Sindh and Punjab, Baluchistan is hazardly flooded.
                Pakistan faces some of highest disaster risk levels in the world. It is ranked 18 out of 191 countries by the inform risk index. Along with the risk of earthquakes , Pakistan has the high exposure of flooding, which also includes, riverine, flash, and costal floods, furthermore there are risk of cyclones and drought, senator sherry Rehman the country top climate official said in her video on twitter that Pakistan is facing serious climate catastrophe.
                Pakistan is at the horns of major climate catastrophe, Pakistan either rescues itself from annihilation by taking the issue of climate change as national  emergency or it plunges itself into darkness by ignoring the climate concern just addresses the floods by makeshift arrangements, increasing the water storage capacity, afforestation, infrastructure reforms and research based policy implementation could secure the socio-economic future.
                I hope we take these matters seriously as a nation <br>
                Allah Nigheban.
