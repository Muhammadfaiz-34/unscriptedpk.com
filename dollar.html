    <h2 class="heading">Economic crisis in Pakistan due to Dollar</h2>
    <p class="p1-text">
        Since the US withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan, the dollar has been flowing
        out of Pakistan to Afghanistan. The US froze the Afghan reserves after the Taliban
        took over war raged country last summer. Afghanistan has since then become an importer of 
        dollars, opposite to its role of exporter of dollars till the presence of US Forces in Afghanistan
        The Exchange companies associated of Pakistan has termed the change of role of Afghanistan as an adversely
        affecting factor on the weakening external sector of Pakistan. Accompanied by the trade ad current account deficits and 
        decreasing multilateral inflows of dollars, illegal inflows of dollar and illegal outflow of dollars has caused Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves. Furthermore, the Taliban directive to afghan citizens to convert Pakistan currency into dollars aggravated the situation. The outflow of dollar is not only directed towards Afghanistan; it has been flowing to the gulf as well, the already dwindling economy faces a looming threat of default, Pakistan now finds itself in a situation where it has a Hobson’s choice to agree to IMF restriction and implement the package. Once agreed to IMF, Pakistan is in for a dime, in for a dollar because once committed to IMF package, the country must implement it completely without sparing any effort.</p>

The economy of Pakistan faces multiple challenges, A major challenge for the country is its fuel consumption bill, it amounts to almost USD 27 billion. The flood related reconstruction cost amount to USD 1.1 billion, and the IMF has Pakistan to include the costs in the current budget. The IMF has also expressed reservations over the recently announced package for the agricultural sector amounts to PKR 1800 bn and PKR 110 bn subsidies for electricity sector. These have been termed as violation for the 7th and 8th review. The current and previous finance minister also disagree on the country performance for IMF review. There also have been speculations over the risk of default, Prime minister of Pakistan Shahbaz sharif termed it as a painful reality that the country has no option but to implement the IMF Program. The government expressed helplessness along with blaming the previous government but thee previous government outperformed this government in every sector.
Pakistan must brace themselves with realistic and brave decisions now, the country needs to strengthen its control over land bordersland and ports to ward off the dollar’s high flight from the country. The country must also recognize the importance of avoiding politics over economic issues.
But currently the country is in for a dime, in for a dollar with IMF.
